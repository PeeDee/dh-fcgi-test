This project should have all the files necessary to test your Dreamhost support of camping using fcgi.

The idea is that you copy these files into a directory, point a Dreamhost domain or sub-domain at that directory, and you are camping.

Steps:
  1) Download camping gem and dependencies directly from _why site.
  2) Edit fastcgi.rb in two places.
  3) Copy these files into a directory on Dreamhost
  4) Edit dispatch.fcgi for your account name on gem paths
  5) Point a domain at the script directory
  6) Hit the url.

WARNING: 

Nothing here works on Dreamhost (for me) as yet...

> camping test.rb # works with either start or serve... but violates DH TOS

http://camping.mydomain.net # doesn't work at all...
