This project should have enough files to test your Dreamhost support of camping using fcgi.

The idea is that once you install and edit the camping gem and dependencies (per the above posts) you can copy these .htaccess, dispatch.fcgi and test.rb files into a directory, edit dispatch.fcgi to use your own account name, point a Dreamhost domain or sub-domain at that directory, and you are camping.

Steps:
  1) Download camping gem and dependencies directly from _why site.
  2) Edit fastcgi.rb in two places.
  3) Copy the files here into a directory on Dreamhost, eg. ~/camping/test
  4) Edit dispatch.fcgi for your account name on gem paths
  5) Set the permission for dispatch.fcgi to execute (ie. chmod 755 dispatch.fcgi)
  5) Point a domain (or sub-domain) at the script directory
  6) Hit the url.

WARNING: 

It does seem to take a few minutes for things to work, and that can be misleading and frustrating.

Much thanks to Eric for helping me out.
